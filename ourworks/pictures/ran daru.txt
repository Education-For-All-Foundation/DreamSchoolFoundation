We believe the education of children is among the most pressing needs of this day and age. That is why the Ran Daru Thilina initiative seeks to drive home the importance of education among the children

Ran Daru Scholarships specifically targets children sitting for the crucial scholarship exams in Grade 5. Stemming from Ran Daru Thilina’s steadfast belief that educational obstacles facing children should be removed, it offers children of associates the peace of mind that comes from knowing they can continue their school education unimpeded.
