wash away the poor hygiene issues
Creating a healthy and child friendly learning environment for children at early ages is critical for their better growth. Hygienic habits that children learn in their formative years help them practice this behavior in their families and pass on the knowledge to society.  When children are equipped with the right skills, they are the best change agents.” said, Mrs. Sian Platt, Plan International Sri Lanka, Acting Country Director.  “Our water, sanitation and hygiene programme is both school and community-led, which aligns with our child-centred community development approach.  We work to ensure children and community members have a voice and choice in the decisions that affect their lives, and that enable them to act as agents of change. We work closely with children in schools, preschools with their families and communities. This includes the provision of inclusive, age appropriate and child friendly water and sanitation services for schools and preschools. Furthermore, teaching appropriate skills and practices to promote good hygiene practices among school children is considered an essential part of our water, sanitation and hygiene promotion programmes, which is why we are pleased to partner with Unilever in supporting the school children of Padaviya
