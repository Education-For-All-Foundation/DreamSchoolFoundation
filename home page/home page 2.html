                    <p>Poverty makes all people helpless. Lack of access to eduction can be a side effect of proverty.
                        poverty is compounded by a lack of food,water and money to buy medicines for illnesses.
                        Creating a healthy and child friendly learning environment for children at early ages is critical for their better growth.
                         Hygienic habits that children learn in their formative years help them practice this behavior in their families and pass on the knowledge to society
                        We’re passionate about all children having a safe and happy childhood.
                        We’re ambitious for children and young people.
                        We collaborate internally and externally with other organisations to get the best outcomes for children.
                        We're inclusive, and strive to ensure that all children are included.     <br><br>  
                        we hope to add a smile to the faces of the children of such poor families. I will protect them. we are keen to give them a safe and happy childhood

                     <p>When I was at university, I had the opportunity to seee the growth and development of children
                         in need when St.marry volunteered for orpanages and family services. Children have experienced a lot of pain in the past.
                       so we all donated to the Dream School Foundtaion. Through them we gave our gifts. we were pleased to learn that it has a positive effect on the lives of children.

                  <p>In 2020, I got my first appointment and went on to work in difficult school. A lot of thos kids' families are low-income.
                      They didi not have the necessary equipment for education. I discussed with the Dream School Foundtaion about that.
                      That way I gave them Uniforms, shoes, Books,pens, pencils and ect. It's really a matter of happiness. I am excited about this project.
